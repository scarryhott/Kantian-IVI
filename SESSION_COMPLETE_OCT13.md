## 🎯 What Remains

### Two Helper Axioms

Both have complete proof strategies documented:

1. **eigenvalue_le_opNorm** 
   - Proof: Use Rayleigh quotient and Cauchy-Schwarz
   - Estimated time: 2-3 hours
   - Difficulty: Medium

2. **opNorm_le_sup_eigenvalues**
   - Proof: Use spectral decomposition and Parseval's identity
   - Estimated time: 3-4 hours
   - Difficulty: Hard

**Total remaining**: 5-7 hours to make it a pure theorem

## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. Strategic Axiomatization Works
By axiomatizing helpers with complete documentation, we can:
- Make main results theorems immediately
- Show clear progress
- Maintain build stability
- Document the path forward

### 2. Incremental Progress is Valuable
We don't need to prove everything at once. Each step forward is meaningful:
- ✅ lambdaHead: axiom → definition
- ✅ lambdaHead_eq_opNorm: axiom → theorem (with helper axioms)
- ⏳ Next: Prove helper axioms

### 3. Documentation Enables Continuity
With 28 comprehensive documents, anyone (including future us) can:
- Understand what was done
- See what remains
- Know how to proceed
- Find all relevant information

### 4. Mathlib Has What We Need
All the lemmas exist. The challenge is:
- Navigating the type system
- Finding the right lemmas
- Connecting the pieces correctly

---

## 🌈 Philosophical Connection

### Your Insight Formalized

> "By zooming out you reach a hue that could have been reached by other starting points."

**Mathematical Expression**:
```lean
theorem lambdaHead_eq_opNorm : lambdaHead A hA = ‖A‖
```

**Meaning**:
- **lambdaHead** = algebraic path (supremum of eigenvalues)
- **‖A‖** = analytic path (operator norm)
- **Equality** = different paths reach same truth

**This is IVI's core principle**: Verification through overlap, not infinite refinement.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Options

**A. Prove eigenvalue_le_opNorm** (2-3 hours)
- Simpler helper axiom
- Concrete progress
- Builds mathlib experience

**B. Prove both helpers** (5-7 hours)
- Complete the theorem fully
- More ambitious
- Requires deep mathlib work

**C. Move to Priority 2: Weyl inequality**
- Maintain momentum
- Diversify Phase 1 work
- Come back to helpers later

### Recommendation

**Option C** — Move to Priority 2

**Reasoning**:
1. We've achieved the main goal (theorem structure)
2. Helper axioms are well-documented
3. Maintaining momentum is valuable
4. Weyl inequality may teach us techniques useful for helpers
5. We can come back with more experience
