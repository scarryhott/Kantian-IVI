# Helper Axioms Status â€” Update (October 14, 2025)

Both helper lemmas that previously supported `lambdaHead_eq_opNorm` are now fully proven:

1. `eigenvalue_le_opNorm`
2. `opNorm_le_sup_eigenvalues`

They live in `IVI/RealSpecMathlib.lean` and eliminate the last logical gaps in the spectral norm equivalence.

---

## What Changed

- Removed the `axiom` declarations and replaced them with constructive proofs.
- Updated documentation and planning files (`PRIORITY_1_PROGRESS.md`, `NEXT_WORK.md`, `REMAINING_AXIOMS_ANALYSIS.md`).
- `lambdaHead_eq_opNorm` now depends exclusively on proven theorems.

---

## Next Targets

- Tackle `operator_norm_bound` to secure quantitative bounds.
- Prepare for the power iteration and Lipschitz axioms in later phases.

Progress on these tasks is tracked in `NEXT_WORK.md`.
