## How to Use This Codebase

### As-Is (Current State)

The system **compiles and runs** with:
```bash
lake build && lake exe ivi-demo
```

All operations are **computationally sound** - the runtime checks verify properties dynamically.

### What's Missing for "Proof-Complete"

The system lacks **static verification** of:
1. Spectral perturbation bounds (Weyl theorem)
2. Convergence guarantees (fixed-point existence)
3. Derivation of some Kantian axioms from primitives

### Recommended Approach

**For practical use**: The current system is ready. Runtime checks provide empirical validation.

**For formal verification**: Follow `PROOF_ROADMAP.md` starting with P0 items:
1. Decide on Weyl bound approach (axiom vs. proof)
2. Complete T2 non-collapse preservation
3. Close soundness theorem

---

## Axiom Inventory

### Permanent Axioms (Foundational)

These are **intentionally axiomatic** - they represent the transcendental ground:

- **A3**: Unity of apperception
- **A4**: Noumenal limit  
- **A9**: Practical reason aperture
- **A11**: Verification without collapse

### Derived (No Longer Axiomatic) ‚úÖ

These have been **proven** from more primitive principles:

- ‚úÖ **A1**: Inner time ordering (from `InnerTime` typeclass) - 2 versions
- ‚úÖ **A6**: Schematism possible (from `SchematismEvidence`) - Constructively proven
- ‚úÖ **A7**: Reciprocity (from symmetric relations) - Fully proven
- ‚úÖ **A12**: Demand for system (from `closedUnderIVI`) - Proven

### Potentially Derivable (Future Work)

These **could be proven** from more primitive principles (Priority 2):

- **A2**: Categories bind judgment (from `Category` structure)
- **A5**: Regulative ideas (from system closure)
- **A8**: Synthetic a priori (from `harmonize` + `VWM`)
- **A10**: Reflective judgment (from `Will.selectSchema`)

### Analytic Axioms (`IVI/WeylBounds.lean`)

These encode **real analysis** properties:

- `weyl_eigenvalue_bound`: Spectral perturbation theorem
- `graininess_lipschitz`: Grain metric continuity
- `entropy_lipschitz`: Entropy continuity
- `step_matrix_perturbation`: Step-induced perturbation bound

**Status**: Clearly documented with references to mathematical literature

## Testing & Validation

### What's Tested

- ‚úÖ Type checking (all files compile)
- ‚úÖ Demo execution (`lake exe ivi-demo`)
- ‚úÖ Proven lemmas in `IVI/Proofs.lean`
- ‚úÖ Contract assembly in `IVI/KakeyaBounds.lean`

### What's Runtime-Checked

- Spectral invariant convergence
- Fixed-point conditions
- Lambda-vector stability
- Community predicates

### What Needs Formal Proof

See Priority 0-3 sections above and `PROOF_ROADMAP.md`

## Contributing

### Adding Proofs

1. Pick an item from `PROOF_ROADMAP.md`
2. Start with P0 (critical path) items
3. Use `IVI/WeylBounds.lean` as a template for axiomatization
4. Use `IVI/Proofs.lean` for examples of complete proofs

### Replacing Axioms

To replace an axiom with a proof:

1. Import necessary mathlib modules
2. Prove the theorem using mathlib's spectral theory
3. Remove the `axiom` declaration
4. Update this status document

### Testing Changes

```bash
# Build everything
lake build

# Run demo
lake exe ivi-demo

# Build specific file
lake build IVI.YourFile
```

## Conclusion

The Kantian-IVI project has a **solid proof architecture** with:
- Clear separation between axioms and derived results
- Computational soundness (runtime validation)
- Path to formal completeness (roadmap established)

The critical bottleneck is the **Weyl spectral bound**. Once that's resolved (by proof or documented axiom), the rest of the soundness chain can be completed using existing infrastructure.

**Current recommendation**: Accept the Weyl bound as a documented axiom (as done in `IVI/WeylBounds.lean`) and proceed with completing the soundness theorem. This provides a working system with clear documentation of foundational assumptions.
