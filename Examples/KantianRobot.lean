  Examples/KantianRobot.lean
  A practical demonstration of the Kantian-IVI framework
  applied to the design of a humanoid robot.
  
  This example shows how to:
  1. Start with a spiritual concept ("companionship")
  2. Progressively materialize it through fractal expansion
  3. Maintain the connection to the original meaning

A robot that provides meaningful companionship.

Breaking down companionship into core capabilities.
