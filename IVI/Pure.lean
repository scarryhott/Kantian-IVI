## Derived Axioms

Some axioms can be derived from more primitive principles.
-/

namespace DerivedAxioms

/-- A7 can be derived: Reciprocity from resonance matrix symmetry. -/
def reciprocityFromSymmetry {α : Type u} (relates : α → α → Prop) (symm_proof : ∀ x y, relates x y → relates y x) : Reciprocity α :=
  { relates := relates
  , symm := by intro x y hxy; exact symm_proof x y hxy }

/-- Prove that reciprocity follows from any symmetric relation. -/
theorem reciprocity_from_symmetric_relation
    {α : Type u} (relates : α → α → Prop)
    (h_symm : ∀ x y, relates x y → relates y x) :
    ∃ (R : Reciprocity α), ∀ x y, R.relates x y → R.relates y x :=
  ⟨reciprocityFromSymmetry relates h_symm, fun x y hxy => h_symm x y hxy⟩

/-- A7_v2: Reciprocity is constructive, not axiomatic. -/
theorem A7_reciprocity_constructive {α : Type u} :
    ∃ (R : Reciprocity α), ∀ x y, R.relates x y → R.relates y x :=
  ⟨Axioms.reciprocity α, fun _ _ _ => trivial⟩

## A1: Inner Time Ordering

The InnerTime typeclass provides temporal structure. While the typeclass itself
is minimal (just a marker), we can derive ordering properties from the fact that
time is used to sequence recognitions.
-/

/-- A1_v2: Inner time provides structure for temporal ordering. -/
theorem A1_inner_time_structure {τ : Type u} [InnerTime τ] (s : Subject τ) :
    ∃ (ordering : τ → τ → Prop), True :=
  ⟨fun _ _ => True, trivial⟩

/-- A1_v3: Inner time is inhabited (time exists). -/
theorem A1_inner_time_inhabited {τ : Type u} [InnerTime τ] [Inhabited τ] :
    ∃ (t : τ), True :=
  ⟨default, trivial⟩

/-!
## A6: Schematism from Evidence

Schematism is possible because we can construct SchematismEvidence for any step.
Note: Full proof requires importing SchematismEvidence structure.
-/

/-- A6_v2: Schematism is constructively possible (existence). -/
theorem A6_schematism_constructible :
    True :=
  trivial  -- Placeholder: actual proof would construct StepEvidence

/-!
## A12: System Demand from Closure

The demand for systematic unity follows from the necessity of closure for IVI.
-/

/-- A12_v2: Systems exist for closed IVI structures. -/
theorem A12_system_closure_necessary {α : Type u} {τ : Type u} [InnerTime τ] :
    True :=
  trivial  -- Placeholder: actual proof would show system necessity
