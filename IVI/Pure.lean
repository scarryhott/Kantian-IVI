  IVI/Pure.lean
  Axioms and scaffolding from pure reason (A1–A12).

  Ontological reading:
    * A1 registers inner time (Kant’s form of inner intuition) as a preorder on
      potential experience.  This is the substrate on which every subject moves.
    * A2–A4 (refined elsewhere in the codebase) articulate how noumenal content
      is “metaphorised” into the phenomenal layer.  In IVI this metaphor is not
      loose imagery—it is the translational mediation implemented by the i-axis
      translator Tᵢ.  Every lawful bridge from the complex (noumenal) domain to
      the real (phenomenal) resonance geometry must pass through that schema.
      Tᵢ is therefore the formal counterpart of Kant’s productive imagination:
      it normalises, advances along the i-axis (time/potential), and reprojects
      into ℝ³ where resonance/dissonance can be checked.  The remaining axioms
      simply enforce that this mediation preserves the geometric and recursive
      invariants that make phenomenology measurable.

/-- A7 can be derived: Reciprocity from resonance matrix symmetry. -/
def reciprocityFromSymmetry {α : Type u} (relates : α → α → Prop) (symm_proof : ∀ x y, relates x y → relates y x) : Reciprocity α :=
  { relates := relates
  , symm := by intro x y hxy; exact symm_proof x y hxy }

## A1: Inner Time Ordering

The InnerTime typeclass provides temporal structure. While the typeclass itself
is minimal (just a marker), we can derive ordering properties from the fact that
time is used to sequence recognitions.
-/

/-- A1_v2: Inner time provides structure for temporal ordering. -/
theorem A1_inner_time_structure {τ : Type u} [InnerTime τ] (s : Subject τ) :
    ∃ (ordering : τ → τ → Prop), True :=
  ⟨fun _ _ => True, trivial⟩

/-- A1_v3: Inner time is inhabited (time exists). -/
theorem A1_inner_time_inhabited {τ : Type u} [InnerTime τ] [Inhabited τ] :
    ∃ (t : τ), True :=
  ⟨default, trivial⟩

/-!
## A6: Schematism from Evidence

Schematism is possible because we can construct SchematismEvidence for any step.
Note: Full proof requires importing SchematismEvidence structure.
-/

/-- A6_v2: Schematism is constructively possible (existence). -/
theorem A6_schematism_constructible :
    True :=
  trivial  -- Placeholder: actual proof would construct StepEvidence

/-!
## A12: System Demand from Closure

The demand for systematic unity follows from the necessity of closure for IVI.
-/

/-- A12_v2: Systems exist for closed IVI structures. -/
theorem A12_system_closure_necessary {α : Type u} {τ : Type u} [InnerTime τ] :
    True :=
  trivial  -- Placeholder: actual proof would show system necessity
