  Real (ℝ) Weyl inequality — mathlib-backed scaffold.

  This file prepares a mathlib-based environment to eventually provide a
  proof of a Weyl-style eigenvalue perturbation bound. We keep the bridge
  between the project's `RealMatrix` (List(List ℝ)) and mathlib's
  `Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ` abstract for now.

We model the connection via an abstract embedding from our `RealMatrix`
(List (List ℝ)) into a finite-dimensional mathlib matrix. The proof will
use mathlib's spectral theory over that embedding. For now, we keep the
embedding axiomatized to avoid blocking on index bookkeeping.

Weyl inequality (sketch wrapper): If the operator norm of the perturbation E is
≤ ε (in the embedded sense), then the change in dominant eigenvalue is ≤ ε.

This is stated against our project types but will be proven via mathlib on the
embedded matrices. For now we declare it as an axiom and will replace with an
actual proof after the embedding is implemented.

## Parametric Real matrices using mathlib

We work with `RealMatrixN n := Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ` and provide
a Hermitian (symmetric) Weyl inequality using mathlib's spectral theory.

### Spectral Theory as Color Theory

The eigenvalue spectrum of a matrix can be understood as its "color" —
the set of resonance frequencies that define its character.

- **Eigenvalues (λ)** = frequencies (hues)
- **Eigenvectors** = directions of resonance (saturation)
- **Spectral norm (‖·‖)** = maximum frequency (brightness)

Weyl's inequality states that perturbations shift the spectrum (change the color)
by at most the norm of the perturbation. This is **complementary color theory**:
the hue shift is bounded by the intensity of the mixing.

**Connection to Kantian-IVI**:
- **Space (dark)** = potential eigenspace (unobserved, λ = 0)
- **Time (light)** = observed eigenvalue (collapsed, λ ≠ 0)
- **Color** = spectral resonance (verified relation)
- **Dark matter** = uncollapsed superposition (no time, λ = 0)
- **Light form** = pure observation (no space, λ → ∞)

See `COLOR_THEORY.md` for the full philosophical interpretation.

## Dominant Eigenvalue for Symmetric Matrices

For a symmetric real matrix, we define the dominant eigenvalue as the
largest eigenvalue. This is well-defined via mathlib's Hermitian spectral theory.

NOTE: Full implementation requires mathlib's `Matrix.IsHermitian.eigenvalues` and
related lemmas. For now, we axiomatize the definition and the Weyl bound, but
the structure is correct for a future mathlib-backed proof.
-/

/-- 
Dominant eigenvalue (largest eigenvalue) of a symmetric real matrix.

For a symmetric (Hermitian) matrix, we take the supremum of its eigenvalues.
This is well-defined since symmetric matrices have real eigenvalues.

NOTE: This definition is currently axiomatized pending full mathlib integration.
The correct implementation would use:
- `Matrix.IsHermitian.eigenvalues : Fin n → ℝ` (from mathlib)
- `lambdaHead A = Finset.univ.sup' (by decide) (Matrix.IsHermitian.eigenvalues hA)`

For now, we axiomatize with the understanding that this is a standard definition.
-/
/-- 
Dominant eigenvalue (largest eigenvalue in absolute value) of a matrix.

For symmetric matrices, this equals the spectral radius and is the largest
real eigenvalue. For now, we axiomatize this as we need more mathlib
infrastructure for matrix norms.

TODO: Define via operator norm once matrix norm instances are available.

## Weyl's Inequality for Symmetric Matrices

Weyl's inequality states that for symmetric matrices A and E:
  |λᵢ(A + E) - λᵢ(A)| ≤ ‖E‖

where ‖·‖ is the operator (spectral) norm.

For the dominant eigenvalue (i=1), this gives:
  |λ₁(A + E) - λ₁(A)| ≤ ‖E‖

This is a standard result in matrix perturbation theory and would be proven
using mathlib's:
- `Matrix.IsHermitian` (symmetric matrices are Hermitian over ℝ)
- Operator norm characterization
- Spectral theorem for Hermitian matrices
- Weyl's perturbation inequality

TODO: Replace this axiom with a proof once mathlib's Hermitian spectral
theory is fully integrated. The statement is correct and the proof is standard.

Weyl's inequality for symmetric matrices.

For symmetric matrices, the dominant eigenvalue (spectral radius) shifts

## Notes on Implementation

To fully prove `weyl_eigenvalue_bound_real_n` from mathlib, we would:

1. Use `Matrix.IsSymmetric` (already in mathlib)
2. Convert to `Matrix.IsHermitian` (symmetric ℝ matrices are Hermitian)
3. Use `Matrix.IsHermitian.eigenvalues` to get eigenvalues
4. Define `lambdaHead` as the supremum of eigenvalues
5. Apply Weyl's inequality for Hermitian matrices:
   - This may require importing or proving a Weyl-type lemma
   - Standard reference: Horn & Johnson, "Matrix Analysis" (1985), Theorem 6.3.5
6. Use operator norm properties to conclude

The axiom above is a placeholder for this standard result. The structure
is correct and ready for a mathlib-backed proof.

### Current Status (Phase 1.1)

**What's done**:
- ✅ Mathlib integrated
- ✅ Types refactored to `Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ`
- ✅ Hermitian specialization (symmetric matrices)
- ✅ `lambdaHead` defined (placeholder)
- ✅ Color-theoretic interpretation documented

**What's needed**:
- 🚧 Replace `lambdaHead` placeholder with actual eigenvalue supremum
- 🚧 Prove `weyl_eigenvalue_bound_real_n` using mathlib
- 🚧 Wire Float-to-Real bridge

**Mathlib dependencies needed**:
- `Mathlib.LinearAlgebra.Matrix.Spectrum` (eigenvalues)
- `Mathlib.Analysis.InnerProductSpace.Spectrum` (Hermitian spectral theorem)
- `Mathlib.Analysis.NormedSpace.OperatorNorm` (operator norm)
- Weyl-type perturbation lemma (may need to prove from scratch)

**Next milestone**: Replace axiom with theorem, reducing axiom count by 1.

## Phase 1.2: Operator Norm Bounds

For runtime matrices with bounded entries and limited sparsity, we can prove
concrete bounds on the operator norm. This is essential for error budgets.

### Entrywise Bounded Matrices

If all entries satisfy |M i j| ≤ c, then the operator norm is bounded by
the matrix dimensions and sparsity.
-/

/-- 
Entrywise bound: all entries of M are bounded by c in absolute value.
-/
def entrywiseBounded {n : Nat} (M : RealMatrixN n) (c : ℝ) : Prop :=
  ∀ i j, |M i j| ≤ c

/--

/-- 
Row sparsity: each row has at most d non-zero entries.
-/
def rowSparsity {n : Nat} (M : RealMatrixN n) (d : Nat) : Prop :=
  ∀ i, (Finset.univ.filter (fun j => M i j ≠ 0)).card ≤ d

/-- 
Operator norm bound for entrywise bounded, sparse matrices.

For a matrix M with |M i j| ≤ c and at most d non-zero entries per row,
the operator norm satisfies ‖M‖ ≤ c√(nd).

This is a standard result in matrix analysis. The proof uses the fact that
for any vector v with ‖v‖ = 1, we have:
  ‖Mv‖² ≤ Σᵢ (Σⱼ |M i j| |v j|)²
        ≤ Σᵢ (c·√d·‖v‖)²  (by Cauchy-Schwarz and sparsity)
        ≤ n·c²·d

Thus ‖M‖ ≤ c√(nd).

For now, we axiomatize pending full mathlib matrix norm infrastructure.

TODO: Prove using Cauchy-Schwarz and direct norm calculation once norms available.

### Application to IVI Runtime Matrices

In the IVI runtime, resonance matrices have:
- Bounded entries: |M i j| ≤ 1 (normalized resonance values)
- Sparse rows: each node resonates with at most k neighbors

This gives us concrete error budgets for Float computations.

## Phase 1.3: Power Iteration Convergence

Power iteration is used in IVI to find dominant eigenvectors (resonance modes).
For symmetric, non-negative matrices, convergence is guaranteed by the
Perron-Frobenius theorem.

### Power Iteration Algorithm

Given matrix M and initial vector v₀:
- vₖ₊₁ = M vₖ / ‖M vₖ‖
- As k → ∞, vₖ → dominant eigenvector

### Convergence Conditions

For symmetric, non-negative M with dominant eigenvalue λ₁ > |λ₂|:
- Power iteration converges to eigenvector of λ₁
- Convergence rate: O((λ₂/λ₁)ᵏ)

## Phase 1.4: Lipschitz Continuity

Graininess and entropy are Lipschitz continuous functions of the system state.
This ensures smooth evolution and bounded sensitivity to perturbations.

### Lipschitz Continuity

A function f is Lipschitz continuous with constant L if:
  |f(x) - f(y)| ≤ L |x - y|

For IVI:
- Graininess is Lipschitz (small state changes → small graininess changes)
- Entropy is Lipschitz (small state changes → small entropy changes)

Graininess is Lipschitz continuous.

This ensures smooth evolution of consciousness (i-dimension).

axiom entropy_lipschitz :

### Application to IVI Evolution

Lipschitz continuity guarantees:
- No discontinuous jumps in graininess (consciousness evolves smoothly)
- No discontinuous jumps in entropy (information evolves smoothly)
- Bounded sensitivity to perturbations (stability)

This is essential for the Kakeya bounds and liminal persistence (A11).
