# Kantian-IVI: Overview

**Thesis.** Time as we measure it (`t`) is **phenomenal** and **emergent**. A deeper, **noumenal** evolution coordinate `i` exists and is “space-like” in structure. The IVI operators:

- `Q` — quaternionic (unitary) *flow* in `i` (noumenal dynamics),
- `F` — fractalization/branching (creates grain κ → matter, information),
- `K` — projection/collapse (heat-dependent) mapping `i → t`.

## Core picture

- **Local (i-flat):** Kakeya saturation removes `t` as an independent coordinate; geometry carries an invariant `m ℓ²`.
- **Global (heat-projected):** `k_B T` turns on the projection; `i` unfolds logarithmically into `t`.

## Canonical equalities (used throughout)

- **Kakeya saturation:** `j ℓ² = 1`, with `j := m ℓ² / t²`.
- **Local time from matter+extent:** `t = √m · ℓ²`.
- **Global i-time:** `i(t) = (2/3) m^{3/2} ln|t| + C`.
- **Invariant at saturation:** `j dt² = m ℓ²` (time cancels).

## Metric deformation (weak-field, lapse)



g00(x) ≈ - [ 1 + 2Φ/c² − ε_grain F(κ(x)) + ε_flat G(T(x)) ].


- Grain term **thickens** time (extra dilation).
- Heat term **flattens** time (undoes dilation).
