# Time as Geometry (Local) and Projection (Global)

## Local: i-flat sheet

Kakeya saturation `j ℓ² = 1` with `j = m ℓ² / t²` forces


t = √m · ℓ², and j dt² = m ℓ².

Hence the interval becomes purely spatial along the saturated direction:


ds²_local → γ_ij dx^i dx^j, i.e. g00 → 0, dτ = 0 for finite dt.


## Global: heat-projected time

The projection weight


W(x) := 1 + 2Φ/c² − ε_grain F(κ) + ε_flat G(T).

- `W>0`: clocks tick (`g00 = −W < 0`).
- Matching to local i-flat demands `W → 0` on the saturated sheet.

**Interpretation.** Locally, time dissolves; globally, heat paints time on the manifold.
