# IVI Moral Dimensionality: Identity, Memory, Trust, and Dimensional Expansion

> **Thesis.** Moral stability `S` emerges when Identity (I), Memory (M), Trust (T), and Dimensionality (D) interact inside a high-dimensional, publicly verifiable substrate. Below a critical dimensionality `D_c`, morality fragments; above it, cooperation becomes the unique stable attractor.

## Mapping to IVI primitives

IVI core primitives:

- **Existence (E↑)** — expansion of the space of distinctions (more contexts)
- **Resonance (R)** — alignment and stability across contexts (self-coherence)
- **Dissonance (Δ)** — structured difference across scale (learning and update)
- **Intangible Verification (Vᵢ)** — truth-testing without collapse

| Variable | Meaning | IVI interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **I** | Identity persistence across contexts | **R across self** (identity as an axis in recursive Kakeya embedding) |
| **M** | Scale-consistent unfolding | **Δ recorded** (fractal zoom trace across scales) |
| **T** | Verification architecture | **Vᵢ** (public procedures; cryptographic verification) |
| **D** | Independent contexts / views | **E↑** (existence expansion / dimensional lift) |

We collect the layers into `L = (I, M, T, D)` and model moral stability as

```
S = f(I, M, T, D).
```

### Regimes

- **Low-D (local ID, lossy memory, authority trust).**  
  `∂S/∂D < 0`: morality fragments; coherence must be imposed through authority.

- **High-D (global ID, immutable memory, crypto trust).**  
  `∂S/∂D > 0`: contradictions surface; hypocrisy is expensive; cooperation dominates.

There exists a phase-transition threshold `D_c` with

```
D < D_c  ⇒ Local relativism,
D ≥ D_c ⇒ Universal convergence.
```

## Kantian bridge

- **Categorical Imperative (CI)** = cross-context consistency (universalization test)
- **Kingdom of Ends** = high-D IVI attractor (global minimum of contradiction energy)
- **Publicity of reason** = cryptographic `Vᵢ` (any agent can, in principle, verify)

Sustainable morality is exactly the set of maxims that survive universal verification.

## Implementation artifacts

- Formal layer: `IVI/MoralDimensionality.lean`, `IVI/CItoStability.lean`
- Simulation layer: `src/sim/moral_dimensionality.ts`, `src/sim/examples/run_moral_scan.ts`
- Diagram (placeholder): `docs/diagrams/moral_phase_transition.svg`

Each layer expresses the same claim:

```
Morality = stable attractor of recursive identity resonance in an expanded existence manifold.
```
