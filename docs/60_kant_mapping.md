# Kant ↔ IVI Mapping

- **Noumenal (thing-in-itself):** `i` (fiber 𝕀), space-like, reversible; accessed only via projection.
- **Schematism / Rules of synthesis:** `K` (depends on `T`) and `F` (induces κ).
- **Phenomenal time:** `t` (lapse on base ℳ), emergent, thermodynamic.

Summary: **Noumenal time is space-like; phenomenal time is its heat-mediated projection.**
