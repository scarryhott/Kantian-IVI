# The Unified IVI Equation

This note packages the evolution rule that anchors Kantian-IVI across mathematics, physics, and Lightmatter’s time-form. It records the minimal axioms, multiple realizations, and ready-to-use scaffolds for both Lean and Python.

## 1. Discrete and Continuous Forms

**Discrete “expand → guide → flatten” step**

```math
S_{t+1} = K\!\left(Q(t) \circ F(S_t)\right)
```

- `F` — fractalization (branch, compose, and grow possibilities)
- `Q(t)` — quaternion flow (smooth, orientation-preserving transport)
- `K` — Kakeya constraint (minimal-width coherence projection)

**Continuous limit**

```math
\frac{dS}{dt} = Q(t)F(S) - \lambda \nabla K(S)
```

`K` doubles as a convex coherence potential; `\lambda > 0` sets flattening strength.

---

## 2. State Space and Operators

Let `(S, d)` be a complete metric (or Banach) space of IVI states. Typical models:

- Finite: weighted hypergraphs of meanings with relational edge labels.
- Continuum: probability measures on a stratified manifold `M` (Wasserstein geometry).

**Operator axioms (minimal)**

| Operator | Requirements |
| --- | --- |
| Fractalization `F : S → S` | monotone expansion `dim F(S) ≥ dim S`, Lipschitz `d(Fx, Fy) ≤ L_F d(x, y)`, locally compositional |
| Quaternion flow `Q(t) : S → S` | (piecewise) one-parameter quasi-isometric group, generated by bounded derivation `G` |
| Kakeya `K : S → S` | proximal map `K = prox_{ηK*}` for lsc convex `K*`, 1-Lipschitz, idempotent on its fixed points |

Define `T_t := K ∘ Q(t) ∘ F`. Under `L_F < ∞` and nonexpansive `Q`, `K`, the iterates `S_{t+1} = T_t(S_t)` are Lipschitz sequences; Banach/Opial yields convergent subsequences. For the ODE, local Lipschitz `QF` plus convex `K*` guarantees existence/uniqueness by Picard + monotone operator theory.

---

## 3. Reading the Law

1. **Expand (`F`)**: grow the field of possibilities.
2. **Guide (`Q`)**: transport and orient via time/symmetry.
3. **Flatten (`K`)**: prune to the narrowest coherent record.

Learning, perception, quantum-to-classical appearance—they all cycle through expand → guide → flatten.

---

## 4. Projections to Known Theories

Let `Π_QM` and `Π_RG` forget unobserved structure.

- **Quantum (Schrödinger-like)**: `Q(t) = e^{-iHt}` on a Hilbert state and small-step-neutral `F` imply, after `Π_QM`, the flow `i ∂_t ψ = H ψ`. Determinacy sits in `K`, not in dynamical collapse.
- **Renormalization**: `F` refines scale, `K` coarse-grains with convex envelope, `Q(t)` transports across shells; `Π_RG` returns the beta function `∂_t g = β(g)` for effective couplings.

These cover the Level-1 consistency proofs in the project roadmap.

---

## 5. Lightmatter Time-Form as `K` Input

Lightmatter models the time-form that tunes `K`’s proximal weight:

```math
W = 1 + \frac{2\Phi}{c^2} - \varepsilon_{\mathrm{grain}} F(\kappa) + \varepsilon_{\mathrm{flat}} G(T)
```

- Larger radiation flattening (`G(T)`) strengthens coherence.
- Graininess (`F(κ)`) thickens time and resists flattening.

In code:

```python
S_next = K(S_guided, weight=W(context))
```

The adapter `ivi_lightmatter.adapter.LightmatterForms` already supplies `W`.

---

## 6. Algorithmic Skeleton

```python
def ivi_step(state, t, F, Q, K, forms):
    expanded = F(state)                 # expand
    guided = Q(t, expanded)             # guide
    W = forms.lapse(context=expanded.meta)
    return K(guided, weight=W)          # flatten
```

```python
def ivi_run(s0, times, F, Q, K, forms):
    s = s0
    for t in times:
        s = ivi_step(s, t, F, Q, K, forms)
    return s
```

---

## 7. Lean Scaffolds (see `IVI/Core/UnifiedEquation.lean`)

```lean
structure Fractal (S : Type _) := (run : S → S)
structure QFlow   (S : Type _) := (run : ℝ → S → S)
structure Kakeya  (S : Type _) := (run : S → S)

def iviStep {S} (F : Fractal S) (Q : QFlow S) (K : Kakeya S)
    (t : ℝ) (s : S) : S :=
  K.run (Q.run t (F.run s))
```

An auxiliary record packages the ODE data: vector field `QF`, coherence potential `K*`, and parameter `λ`. (Full code lives in the Lean module.)

---

## 8. Python Scaffolds (see `packages/ivi-core/ivi_core/unified.py`)

```python
class Fractal(Generic[S]):
    def __call__(self, state: S) -> S: ...

class QuaternionFlow(Generic[S]):
    def __call__(self, t: float, state: S) -> S: ...

class Kakeya(Generic[S]):
    def __call__(self, state: S, *, weight: Mapping[str, Any]) -> S: ...
```

The helper `IVIStep` composes `F`, `Q`, and `K`, while `IVIODE` encodes the continuous form. Lightmatter integration simply passes `LightmatterForms.lapse(...)` as the weight.

---

## 9. Predictions

- ↑ radiation flattening (`G(T)`) ⇒ stronger coherence (`ε_flat < 0` in WLS fits).
- ↑ graininess (`F(κ)`) ⇒ thicker time, weaker coherence (`ε_grain > 0`).
- Clock data tightly bounds `ε_flat`; pulsar lines-of-sight constrain `ε_grain`.
- Creative or learning cycles should exhibit expand→guide→flatten hysteresis in measurable task metrics.

---

The unified equation is the “master law” that glues Kantian phenomenology and Lightmatter physics. All further stories—quantum, RG, learning—are projections or parameterizations of this core compose-and-flatten dynamic.
